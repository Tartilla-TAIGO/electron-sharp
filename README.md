# ElectronSharp

Build cross platform desktop apps with .NET 9 and ASP.NET Core (Razor Pages, MVC), Blazor or [h5](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/h5). 

ElectronSharp is a __wrapper__ around a "normal" Electron application with an embedded ASP.NET Core application. It uses a socket-based IPC bridge we can invoke Electron APIs from .NET.

The CLI extensions hosts the toolset to build and start ElectronSharp-based applications.

ElectronSharp is a hard fork from the original  [Electron.NET](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET) project, mantained by [me](https://github.com/theolivenbaum) and used to build the [Curiosity](https://curiosity.ai) app.


## 📦 NuGet:

* API [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ElectronSharp.API.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronSharp.API/) 
* CLI [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ElectronSharp.CLI.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronSharp.CLI/)

## 🛠 Requirements to run:

The current ElectronSharp CLI builds Windows/macOS/Linux binaries. The API uses .NET 9, so our minimum base OS is the same as [.NET 9](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/supported-os.md).

Also you should have installed:

* npm [contained in nodejs](https://nodejs.org)

## 👩‍🏫 Usage

To activate and communicate with the Electron API, include the [ElectronSharp.API NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronSharp.API/) in your ASP.NET Core app. Check out the Electron.SampleApp for an example of how to use ElectronSharp.

````
PM> Install-Package ElectronSharp.API
````
### Program.cs

You start ElectronSharp up with an `UseElectron` WebHostBuilder-Extension. 

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder.UseElectron(args);
            webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

### Startup.cs

Open the Electron Window in the Startup.cs file: 

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    ...

    // Open the Electron-Window here
    Task.Run(async () => await Electron.WindowManager.CreateWindowAsync());
}
```

## 🚀 Start the Application

To start the application make sure you have installed the "[ElectronSharp.CLI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElectronSharp.CLI/)" packages as global tool:

```
dotnet tool install ElectronSharp.CLI -g
```

At the first time, you need an ElectronSharp project initialization. Type the following command in your app folder:

```
electron-sharp init
```

* Now a electronnet.manifest.json should appear in your ASP.NET Core project
* Now run the following:

```
electron-sharp start
```
### Hint

> If invoking any of those commands gives you strange errors (like .NET 5 not installed), it means you've typed electronize instead of electron-sharp.

### Note
> Only the first run is usually slow due to dependency downloads. The next will go on faster.

## 🔭 Develop ElectronSharp apps using a file watcher

You can use a file watcher mode to monitor your project folder for changes, and automatically restart the project:

```
electron-sharp start /watch
```


## 🐞 Debug

Start your ElectronSharp application with the ElectronSharp CLI command. In Visual Studio attach to your running application instance. Go in the __Debug__ Menu and click on __Attach to Process...__. Sort by your projectname on the right and select it on the list.


## 📔 Usage of the Electron-API

A complete documentation will follow. Until then take a look in the source code of the sample application:  
[ElectronSharp Sample App](https://github.com/theolivenbaum/electron-sharp/tree/main/ElectronSharp.SampleApp)  

  
## ⛏ Build

Here you need the ElectronSharp CLI as well. Type the following command in your ASP.NET Core folder:

```
electronize build /target win
```

There are additional platforms available:

```
electron-sharp build /target win
electron-sharp build /target osx
electron-sharp build /target osx-arm64
electron-sharp build /target linux
```

Those four "default" targets will produce packages for those platforms. Note that the `osx-arm64` is for Apple Silicon Macs.

For certain NuGet packages or certain scenarios you may want to build a pure x86 application. To support those things you can define the desired [.NET runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog), the [electron platform](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#platform) and [electron architecture](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#arch) like this:

```
electron-sharp build /target custom "win7-x86;win32" /electron-arch ia32 
```

The end result should be an electron app under your __/bin/desktop__ folder.

### Note
> macOS builds can't be created on Windows machines because they require symlinks that aren't supported on Windows (per [this Electron issue](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/issues/71)). macOS builds can be produced on either Linux or macOS machines.

## Develop

### Install dotnet tool locally

- Build the CLI tool using `dotnet build`, this should create a nuget package in the artifact directory
- Execute in the main electronnet solution folder

```
dotnet tool update --add-source ./artifacts/ -g electronsharp.cli -v d	
```
